The website <http://animations.dev|animations.dev> in itself describes the course and what it's benefits are. If we need to buy this alone this course is only available for 10 days from 14 Jan to 24 January but it can be bought up for a team or an org anytime of the season.\n\n• There is also student discount (20 %).  \n• Certificate of completion\n• Purchasing Power Parity to avoid heavy fees\n• Future updates are all free \n• Beginner Friendly\n• Certificate of Achievement (Verifiable) \nAs compared to some bad options like the lockpick, hackclub socks ( No offence intended they are good too) and some good options like Zines by Julia Evans , Github Pins and Factorio Game this is a great choice.\n\nNote that this is not a promotion of the course or something but as i told i have been waiting to buy this for months as it is only available for some particular days in a quarter of the year, I follow Emil personally on X and you may also have used some of the components that he have created maybe in IOS / React / Nextjs or in Vanilla JavaScript and Framer Motion.\n\nIt could be the best gift for me this Christmas and New Year and believe me you will thank me for this later.\n\nThe price of this varies according to the region and last time I checked up it was 60 $ (5k INR) for India. Could we please add this ?\n\n\nPS: Upvote this to get this added to the shop","reactions":[{"name":"double-upvote","count":30},{"name":"upvote","count":26}],"upvotes":26,"pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-10-24/7930810544660_c3d4f518decb115dc591_72.jpg","display_name":"OC"}

And the best part is, it's incredibly versatile. It can be used for schoolwork, coding, editing, and much more. It can run Xcode, which is particularly useful for creating apps for the apple ecosystem. If necessary, it could even run a relatively fast Windows VM, which would allow students to get the best of both operating systems. There is clear need for this item - <https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07443MC9UP/p1731168551787859|a poll from November> showed the need for the device - 20% of voters said they would find the Mac Mini M4 useful. Besides, the Mac Mini is a realistic alternative to the Macbook Air, which only has an 8 core CPU and GPU, unlike the mini's 10 core CPU and GPU. The Mini, which starts at 16GB Ram, is much stronger and more affordable than most windows counterparts. In conclusion, the Mac Mini's versatility, pricing, and speed are all factors that draw a single conclusion - that the Mac Mini would be one of the most needed items in the whole High Seas store.\n\nPS: If you agree, go upvote the Mac Mini on the poll!","reactions":[{"name":"upvote","count":27}],"upvotes":27,"pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-12-12/8154018237383_81449598f32d2cdf0730_72.jpg","display_name":"ayaangrover"}

{"ts":"1733249238_382929","user":"U07DHR6J57U","text":"Adding some more information because it seems that's good:\n\nI don't have the pixel watch 2, but as far as I can see, it's a great smartwatch with performant hardware with support for Google's WearOs 5, the latest version of WearOs, meaning it's got the latest SDK level so apps can be developed and tested for the latest software. It's based on android so it's a well documented, standardised and widespread platform which many developers will be familiar with. Apps can be published to the play store similar to normal android apps, so it would pair well with the upcoming <#C07N06B1FDY|> if it is added to the high seas shop.\n\nNot only is it great for development, but it's also a brilliant everyday watch, despite the admittedly rather pitiful battery life (around 24 hours with AOD, although it's better than the original pixel watch and is apparently further improved with WearOs 5). It has very accurate activity tracking and has a smooth, clean and intuitive interface, with a wide range of watch faces made by Google and by other developers, with the ability to code new faces and publish them. It has the option for always on display, meaning that the time can always be seen without having to do weird gestures or manually tap it (flashbacks to Fitbit alta). It also, in my humble opinion, looks really nice, and cases and straps are widely available for it to make it look unique.\n\nOverall, the pixel watch 2 (or even the 3 if hackclub's feeling fancy) would clearly be a brilliant addition to the shop!\n\nIf anyone has any questions to ask or anything to add, feel free to say","pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-07-22/7482728059712_f8391955ced11a54ac6b_72.png","display_name":"Gigi Cat"}

The website <http://animations.dev|animations.dev> in itself describes the course and what it's benefits are. If we need to buy this alone this course is only available for 10 days from 14 Jan to 24 January but it can be bought up for a team or an org anytime of the season.\n\n• There is also student discount (20 %).  \n• Certificate of completion\n• Purchasing Power Parity to avoid heavy fees\n• Future updates are all free \n• Beginner Friendly\n• Certificate of Achievement (Verifiable) \nAs compared to some bad options like the lockpick, hackclub socks ( No offence intended they are good too) and some good options like Zines by Julia Evans , Github Pins and Factorio Game this is a great choice.\n\nNote that this is not a promotion of the course or something but as i told i have been waiting to buy this for months as it is only available for some particular days in a quarter of the year, I follow Emil personally on X and you may also have used some of the components that he have created maybe in IOS / React / Nextjs or in Vanilla JavaScript and Framer Motion.\n\nIt could be the best gift for me this Christmas and New Year and believe me you will thank me for this later.\n\nThe price of this varies according to the region and last time I checked up it was 60 $ (5k INR) for India. Could we please add this ?\n\n\nPS: Upvote this to get this added to the shop","reactions":[{"name":"double-upvote","count":30},{"name":"upvote","count":26}],"upvotes":26,"pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-10-24/7930810544660_c3d4f518decb115dc591_72.jpg","display_name":"OC"}

And the best part is, it's incredibly versatile. It can be used for schoolwork, coding, editing, and much more. It can run Xcode, which is particularly useful for creating apps for the apple ecosystem. If necessary, it could even run a relatively fast Windows VM, which would allow students to get the best of both operating systems. There is clear need for this item - <https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07443MC9UP/p1731168551787859|a poll from November> showed the need for the device - 20% of voters said they would find the Mac Mini M4 useful. Besides, the Mac Mini is a realistic alternative to the Macbook Air, which only has an 8 core CPU and GPU, unlike the mini's 10 core CPU and GPU. The Mini, which starts at 16GB Ram, is much stronger and more affordable than most windows counterparts. In conclusion, the Mac Mini's versatility, pricing, and speed are all factors that draw a single conclusion - that the Mac Mini would be one of the most needed items in the whole High Seas store.\n\nPS: If you agree, go upvote the Mac Mini on the poll!","reactions":[{"name":"upvote","count":27}],"upvotes":27,"pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-12-12/8154018237383_81449598f32d2cdf0730_72.jpg","display_name":"ayaangrover"}

They are renowned for their reliability and are especially popular among Linux users, in part due to the sleek and traditional ThinkPad aesthetic and build quality (see:\n<https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGV/p1731181236115449>\n<https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07PZMBUNDS/p1731423811768449?thread_ts=1731423811.768449&amp;cid=C07PZMBUNDS>\n<https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGV/p1731859641564429?thread_ts=1731859519.887829&amp;cid=C0266FRGV>\n<https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0K3R2SD8/p1730321554437339>\n<https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGV/p1725893317707399?thread_ts=1725887220.245529&amp;cid=C0266FRGV><https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGV/p1725893317707399?thread_ts=1725887220.245529&amp;cid=C0266FRGV)|)>\n\n\nSo it would clearly be a great addition, but what model should be gotten, and where would they be sourced from?\n\n\nFor a very budget option, the thinkpad t480 or t490 would be a good option, since they have a reasonably good, somewhat recent CPU, but are old enough to be heavily discounted.\nUK amazon:\n£185 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T480-Windows-Ultrabook/dp/B0BY937M5D>\n£216 (It's got more ram) <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T490-14-Laptop/dp/B0CMQM6977>\n\n\nUS amazon:\n$179 (why are they so much cheaper in the US for better specs??) <https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T480-14-Laptop/dp/B091B8GVVV>\n$227.90 (more storage ) <https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T490-Notebook-Quad-core/dp/B08SHML435>\n\n\n\nAlternatively, a more recent thinkpad, such as the 1st and 2nd gen of the new naming scheme, would offer better performance at a still reduced price.\nUK amazon:\n£319 (i5 10th gen CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 13.3\" screen would fit better in a backpack, I know, I have a 13.3\" and a 14\" laptop and the extra 0.7\" makes the 14\" so much more inconvenient, although it does have more limited IO (no ethernet)) <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Touchscreen-i5-10310U-Keyboard/dp/B0D2D8P1SN>\n\n£419.99 (Ryzen 3 4450U, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, IT HAS MY BELOVED ETHERNET PORT) <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Touchscreen-Fingerprint-Upgradable/dp/B0CKR77MRZ>\n\nUS amazon:\n$270 (i5 10th gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD (again why are they so much cheaper in america, it would probably cost less to buy them to hq in america and then ship them out from there) <https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Thinkpad-T14-Thunderbolt-Windows/dp/B0BDGB49KW>\n\n$309.99 (i5 11th gen, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) <https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Thinkpad-Laptop-i5-1145G7-Renewed/dp/B0DGYXJCCF>\n\n\n\nMaybe it could be done as sort of a thinkpad lottery, where you know you'll get at least a t480, but anything from that up to the Gen 2 of the new naming scheme?

It's based on android so it's a well documented, standardised and widespread platform which many developers will be familiar with. Apps can be published to the play store similar to normal android apps, so it would pair well with the upcoming <#C07N06B1FDY|> if it is added to the high seas shop.\n\nNot only is it great for development, but it's also a brilliant everyday watch, despite the admittedly rather pitiful battery life (around 24 hours with AOD, although it's better than the original pixel watch and is apparently further improved with WearOs 5). It has very accurate activity tracking and has a smooth, clean and intuitive interface, with a wide range of watch faces made by Google and by other developers, with the ability to code new faces and publish them. It has the option for always on display, meaning that the time can always be seen without having to do weird gestures or manually tap it (flashbacks to Fitbit alta). It also, in my humble opinion, looks really nice, and cases and straps are widely available for it to make it look unique.\n\nOverall, the pixel watch 2 (or even the 3 if hackclub's feeling fancy) would clearly be a brilliant addition to the shop!\n\nIf anyone has any questions to ask or anything to add, feel free to say","pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-07-22/7482728059712_f8391955ced11a54ac6b_72.png","display_name":"Gigi Cat"}
