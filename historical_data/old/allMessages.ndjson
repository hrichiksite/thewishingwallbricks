The website <http://animations.dev|animations.dev> in itself describes the course and what it's benefits are. If we need to buy this alone this course is only available for 10 days from 14 Jan to 24 January but it can be bought up for a team or an org anytime of the season.\n\n• There is also student discount (20 %).  \n• Certificate of completion\n• Purchasing Power Parity to avoid heavy fees\n• Future updates are all free \n• Beginner Friendly\n• Certificate of Achievement (Verifiable) \nAs compared to some bad options like the lockpick, hackclub socks ( No offence intended they are good too) and some good options like Zines by Julia Evans , Github Pins and Factorio Game this is a great choice.\n\nNote that this is not a promotion of the course or something but as i told i have been waiting to buy this for months as it is only available for some particular days in a quarter of the year, I follow Emil personally on X and you may also have used some of the components that he have created maybe in IOS / React / Nextjs or in Vanilla JavaScript and Framer Motion.\n\nIt could be the best gift for me this Christmas and New Year and believe me you will thank me for this later.\n\nThe price of this varies according to the region and last time I checked up it was 60 $ (5k INR) for India. Could we please add this ?\n\n\nPS: Upvote this to get this added to the shop","reactions":[{"name":"double-upvote","users":["U06DS214ULB","U07SVH22EBF","U062UG485EE","U0828MFCD99","U078H6SG59Q","U04GVEDH049","U07UV4R2G4T","U07972SC7A9","U07QKF9LB19","U07C4TK524Q","U05A3TSL7UY","U07UK4S94KC","U081X6EUWE4","U06MC0G7A4R","U0828RTU7FE","U07ES48RES3","U078GJ63AQ0","U07FXPUDYDC","U07E4196AMA","U04VAT4F46R","U04AK830QLW","U081D39L4MD","U0817KE4AG2","U0801PU0MTQ","U081ZC7ES30","U07A7KNEVLH","U081TQNJ8F9","U07P7NMQ4NS","U083H6XP1H6","U078M1GLR34"],"count":30},{"name":"upvote","users":["U0828MFCD99","U07SVH22EBF","U06DS214ULB","U04GVEDH049","U07972SC7A9","U07QKF9LB19","U07C4TK524Q","U05A3TSL7UY","U07UK4S94KC","U081X6EUWE4","U06MC0G7A4R","U0828RTU7FE","U07ES48RES3","U078GJ63AQ0","U07FXPUDYDC","U07E4196AMA","U04VAT4F46R","U081D39L4MD","U0817KE4AG2","U0801PU0MTQ","U081ZC7ES30","U081TQNJ8F9","U07P7NMQ4NS","U083H6XP1H6","U07A7KNEVLH","U078M1GLR34"],"count":26}]}

And the best part is, it's incredibly versatile. It can be used for schoolwork, coding, editing, and much more. It can run Xcode, which is particularly useful for creating apps for the apple ecosystem. If necessary, it could even run a relatively fast Windows VM, which would allow students to get the best of both operating systems. There is clear need for this item - <https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07443MC9UP/p1731168551787859|a poll from November> showed the need for the device - 20% of voters said they would find the Mac Mini M4 useful. Besides, the Mac Mini is a realistic alternative to the Macbook Air, which only has an 8 core CPU and GPU, unlike the mini's 10 core CPU and GPU. The Mini, which starts at 16GB Ram, is much stronger and more affordable than most windows counterparts. In conclusion, the Mac Mini's versatility, pricing, and speed are all factors that draw a single conclusion - that the Mac Mini would be one of the most needed items in the whole High Seas store.\n\nPS: If you agree, go upvote the Mac Mini on the poll!","reactions":[{"name":"upvote","users":["U07BDGCAD6Z","U07C4TK524Q","U04VAT4F46R","U0828MFCD99","U07981R1140","U0829HRSQ76","U0807ADEC6L","U07A7KNEVLH","U07UE4PQRUN","U0801PU0MTQ","U07TYDZCCPR","U077K9VR5LL","U07C3SJ99RP","U07AM3C0VR8","U06HST8URFY","U07UK4S94KC","U07BLFLNXJB","U07GLQY6UN4","U07SX29CECA","U082GTRTR5X","U08310CM2NL","U07P7NMQ4NS","U07SVH22EBF","U081DK1FJHH","U081ZC7ES30","U079UHJDBRT","U081HLUV753"],"count":27}]}

It's based on android so it's a well documented, standardised and widespread platform which many developers will be familiar with. Apps can be published to the play store similar to normal android apps, so it would pair well with the upcoming <#C07N06B1FDY|> if it is added to the high seas shop.\n\nNot only is it great for development, but it's also a brilliant everyday watch, despite the admittedly rather pitiful battery life (around 24 hours with AOD, although it's better than the original pixel watch and is apparently further improved with WearOs 5). It has very accurate activity tracking and has a smooth, clean and intuitive interface, with a wide range of watch faces made by Google and by other developers, with the ability to code new faces and publish them. It has the option for always on display, meaning that the time can always be seen without having to do weird gestures or manually tap it (flashbacks to Fitbit alta). It also, in my humble opinion, looks really nice, and cases and straps are widely available for it to make it look unique.\n\nOverall, the pixel watch 2 (or even the 3 if hackclub's feeling fancy) would clearly be a brilliant addition to the shop!\n\nIf anyone has any questions to ask or anything to add, feel free to say"}

This could work for basically except India, so I feel like India could get charged like 50 doubloons extra if neccessary.\n\nAlso some of the global shipping rates are exorbitantly high, so the doubloons can be modifed for those.\n\n---\n\ni feel like i don't really need to justify that much on why this can be included, seeing that it was already available in arcade. but i just want to point out that mice are very useful, and this is one of the most loved mice by the hacker community.\n\nanyway, since this item does not have the most \"hacker value\", i suggest the price to be set at 600, but honestly it can be more on less\n\nplease consider this for high seas\n\nps: upvote this so we can show our support","reactions":[{"name":"upvote","users":["U078M1GLR34","U07AM3C0VR8","U07E4196AMA","U079SNC1PFF","U07BMK9NSDB","U06DRG3L7AN","U07ABMCT849","U07EB2Y76DP","U06PUN13XHT","U081RRUA09W","U079ZKY1CTU","U07CRGN8BCP","U07DHR6J57U","U07UE4PQRUN","U07GLQY6UN4","U05A3TSL7UY","U079X4D1YTZ","U078YH0MEKW","U07SVH22EBF","U04VAT4F46R","U06MC0G7A4R","U07C3SJ99RP","U082G657Y9F","U0828RTU7FE","U07BDGCAD6Z"],"count":25}]}
